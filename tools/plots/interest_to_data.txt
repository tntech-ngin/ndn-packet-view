This plot will help you visualize the efficiency of the network over time. 
A higher Interest-to-Data ratio may indicate congestion or inefficiencies in the network, 
as more Interest packets are being sent for each Data packet received. 
A lower ratio means the network is functioning more efficiently, with fewer 
Interest packets needed for each Data packet.
